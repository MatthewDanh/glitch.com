          Regarding Autonomous Accidents
          <hr />
        </h1>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>
          The advent of self-driving cars (AV cars) requires thoroughly
          examining accident liability. Potential faults of drivers,
          manufacturers' responsibilities, and software developers’ ethics will
          require a redefinition of obligations concerning legal, financial,
          ethical, and technical responsibilities.  This seemingly
          straightforward question opens up a complex web of legal, ethical, and
          technical considerations that require meticulous examination.
          <br />
          <br />
          Courts have historically adapted to novel product liability questions
          and are expected to do so for autonomous vehicles (Villasenor). In
          comparative negligence systems, determining fault involves evaluating
          the actions of all parties in an accident to allocate blame and affect
          compensation. In pure comparative negligence, each party’s
          compensation is reduced by their percentage of fault, allowing
          recovery even if they are up to 99% at fault. Modified comparative
          negligence systems, using either a 50% or 51% Bar Rule, set a
          threshold where a party must be less at fault than others combined to
          recover damages (McDuffey and Wilson).
          <br />
          <br />
          For the case of AV cars, we need to determine the legal, financial,
          ethical, and technical aspects of liability when we calculate the “at
          fault” liability of each party involved. Liability for potential
          issues with autonomous vehicle technology may shift from the operator
          to the technology's manufacturer. Defining flaws in automated systems
          and determining liability is complicated due to the involvement of
          different stakeholders in the supply chain. Courts will likely face
          more cases based on software defects rather than traditional
          mechanical defects (Villasenor). <br />
          <ul>
            <br />
            <b>Driver:</b>
            <br />
            <li>
              Over 90% of driving accidents are due to human error. Removing
              human drivers should significantly reduce these accidents
              (Villasenor 15). In situations with significant risks, such as
              traffic, ethical considerations cannot be separated from moral and
              legal responsibilities (Nyholm and Smids). Current research stops
              with an abstract principle that only requires technology to
              protect human rights while lacking specific solutions for moral
              dilemmas and conflicts of interest.
            </li>
             
            <br />
            <b>Manufacturer:</b>
            <br />
            <li>
              The advancement of vehicle automation is anticipated to shift the
              responsibility for preventing accidents from the driver to the
              manufacturer. In the United States, product liability is governed
              by common law and Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which
              pertains to the sale of goods, as opposed to federal product
              liability law (Reynolds 269).
            </li>
             
            <br />
            <b>Software Developer:</b>
            <br />
            <li>
              Software product liability claims are usually rooted in strict
              liability, negligence, breach of warranty, or misrepresentation.
              Sometimes, these claims can combine more than one of these legal
              elements (Reynolds 269).
            </li>
          </ul>
          Under strict liability, manufacturers and sellers can be held legally
          responsible for harm caused by defective software, even if not
          negligent. Claims under U.S. common law and the Uniform Commercial
          Code may encompass strict liability, negligence, breach of warranty,
          or misrepresentation. Defendants can invoke defenses such as
          supervening events and the government contractor defense. Statutes of
          limitations necessitate the prompt filing of lawsuits following an
          injury (Reynolds 269). Specific state statutes safeguard original
          manufacturers from liability for defects resulting from third-party
          aftermarket modifications to autonomous vehicles, while others do not
          address liability issues (Villasenor 14).
          <br />
          <br />
          In the near future, as autonomous vehicles become more prevalent,
          human oversight will continue to be necessary, leading to a shared
          liability scenario. Insurance companies will likely have to adapt by
          developing new products or adjusting existing policies to accommodate
          autonomous technology. This could mean that additional vehicle data
          will be needed to investigate accidents. The introduction of
          autonomous vehicles will undoubtedly shake up the relationships
          between insurers, claimants, drivers, and manufacturers, ultimately
          giving rise to the development of new insurance frameworks and
          regulations. We can expect that liability insurance will involve
          insurers seeking reimbursement from manufacturers through legal action
          or other measures after a claim is made.<br />
